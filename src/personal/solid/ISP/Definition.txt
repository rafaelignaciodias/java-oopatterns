Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

Definition
The Interface Segregation Principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
This means that interfaces should be specific to their clients, rather than having a large, general-purpose interface.


Interfaces and Classes
Printer: An interface for printing functionality.
Scanner: An interface for scanning functionality.
MultiFunctionPrinter: A class that implements both Printer and Scanner.
SimplePrinter: A class that implements only the Printer interface.


Benefits of ISP in This Example
Specificity: Clients are not forced to implement methods they do not use, reducing unnecessary dependencies.
Maintainability: Each interface is focused, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
Flexibility: New classes can be added without affecting existing ones, as each can implement only the relevant interfaces.
